# Workshop goals
* Learn how to write simple Makefiles
* Learn how to apply courses workflow
# Tasks
1. Create a git repo that will contain project for 
this workshop 
2. Solve an example task using courses flow
# Example task
1. First iteration: implement summing two 3D vectors (the most natural way)
2. Second iteration: implement a module for manipulating 3D-vectors (sum, sub, dot, cross, etc) using Makefiles

> Important note: consider splitting second iteration into several subtasks and add them to the project board.
